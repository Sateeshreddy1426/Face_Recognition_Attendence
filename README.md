Face Recognition Attendance System Using Deep Learning and Machine Learning
Face recognition attendance systems leverage machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and automation. These technologies allow the system to identify and authenticate individuals by analyzing their facial features and matching them to a pre-trained dataset. Below is an overview of how ML and DL contribute to building such systems:

Overview
Machine Learning: Used for tasks like face detection, feature extraction, and basic classification.
Deep Learning: Utilizes neural networks, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to handle complex patterns and achieve high accuracy in face recognition.
Workflow
Data Collection and Preprocessing

Collect a diverse dataset of facial images under different conditions (e.g., lighting, angles).
Preprocess images:
Resize and normalize.
Remove noise.
Apply augmentation (flipping, rotation, scaling).
Face Detection

Use ML techniques like Haar cascades or DL models like MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) to detect faces in images or video streams.
Feature Extraction

Machine Learning: Algorithms like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) for extracting key features.
Deep Learning: CNNs automatically learn hierarchical features, including edges, shapes, and high-level facial characteristics.
Face Recognition

Train a deep learning model, such as:
Facenet: Uses embeddings to map faces into a vector space.
ResNet or other pre-trained CNN models for transfer learning.
Use a classifier (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Softmax, or KNN) to match extracted features with the stored database.
Attendance Logging

Once a face is recognized, the system marks attendance in a database or a cloud-based system in real time.
